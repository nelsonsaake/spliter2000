Forever in my thoughts and Prayer
I pray in hope for you………………………. (my family, mate or friend).

In the name of the Father and of
the Son and of the Holy Spirit, Amen.

Most merciful Father in whom we place all our trust.
Look upon the sacrifice of our Lord Jesus Christ,

our Savior and Redeemer, who willingly gave himself up on
the cross for us and listen to my prayers,

for my beloved brother/sister
Name……………………………………………………….

Forgive  his/her sins and do not let my brother/ sister
be parted from you, but by your glorious power and infinite

mercy give him/her light, joy and peace in the company of
angels and saints in heaven, where you live and reign forever

and ever. Amen.
Hail Mary, full of grace.

The Lord is with thee.
Blessed art thou among women,

and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.
Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners,

now and at the hour of our death. Amen.
Eternal rest grant unto (Name…………….) O Lord,
